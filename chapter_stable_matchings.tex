\chapter{Stable matchings}

Write function \verb`stable_matchings(F, M)`' which implements stable matchings algorithm. $F$ is a dictionary of priority lists of women and $M$ is a dictionary of priority lists of men. It should return a list of "matching" pairs (female, male).

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{verbatim}
while exists a woman f who is not engaged and has not proposed
to all men do:
    f proposes to her best candidate m, whom she has not yet proposed to;
    if m is not engaged then
        f and m engage to be married
    else if m prefers f to his current fiancee f' then
        f' and m break up their engagement
        f and m engage to be married
    return M
\end{verbatim}
