\chapter*{Foreword}

This book is a collection of notes and exercises from the course \textit{Discrete Mathematics} at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana. This course is a collection of advanced graph algorithms which we partially approach from a mathematical and partially from a computational perspective.
Lecture notes are available at \url{https://matematika.fri.uni-lj.si/dm/discrete_mathematics.pdf}.

The author wishes to thank professor Gašper Fijavž for his encouragement to write this book. Also thanks to Andrej Vodopivec who prepared many of the exercises in this book.
